- Main architecture decisions you've made and a quick explanation of why.

	- I started using MVP architecture, but because of little time didin't was possible to implement at the class MapActivity

- List of third party libraries and why you chose each one.

	- RxJava / Retrofit
		Facilitate the work with the web services from google api

	- Espresso / Mockito / JUnit
		Tests in general

	- Gson
		Parse de Objetos Json to Object and vice versa

	- Butterknife
		View inject, to avoid findViewById

	- Retrolambda
		Use some java 8 features

	- EventBus
		communication between presenter and screeen to decouple the components

- What in your code could be improved if you had more time.

	- Review MVP architecture
	- Error Handling
	- Improve design
	- More animations
	- More Unit Tests
	- Block all identified possible memory leak

- Mention anything that was asked but not delivered and why, and any additional comments.

	- Apparently I implemented all fetures asked
